# odin-stock-picker
The project implements the stock picker method that takes an array of numbers.
The stock picker method returns an array listing a pair of days representing the best days to buy and the best days to sell.
It demonstrates the basic ruby knowledge I learned on The Odin Project.
The project consists of a main ruby file with a ruby test file.

The knowledge applied to this project are as follows:
1. Ruby:
    - Basic data types
    - Variables
    - Input and output
    - Conditional logic
    - Loops
    - Arrays and hashes
    - Methods
    - Debugging
